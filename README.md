# Pricing_Pyschology_Analysis_Dashboard (Power BI)
Power BI dashboard analyzing psychological and rounded pricing impact on conversion and revenue.

This project explores how **psychological vs. rounded pricing strategies** influence customer conversion rates across three business categories using simple, mock data. Built entirely in **Power BI**, the dashboard provides a clear visual analysis of pricing impact.

## Objective

To analyze how **price formatting** (like $19.99 vs $20) affects **conversion rates and revenue** in different pricing categories:
- **Gym**
- **Digital Courses**
- **E-Commerce**

The aim is to help businesses understand which pricing type drives better conversions and in which context.

Shows the entire dataset categorized by:
- Category (Gym, Digital Course, E-Commerce)
- Price Type (Psychological, Rounded)
- Price Range (Low, Mid, High)
- Conversion Rate (%)
- Revenue

### 2. Clustered Column Chart
**Visual**: Conversion Rate (%) by Price Type and Category  
**Insight**: Highlights how psychological pricing performs consistently better than rounded pricing across all categories.

### 3. Donut Charts
**Visuals**: Three separate donut charts showing Conversion Rate Share per Price Type for each category  
**Insight**: Helps compare category-level price type dominance at a glance.

### 4. Stacked Column Chart
**Visual**: Conversion Rate by Price Type across price ranges  
**Insight**: Psychological pricing shows more impact in the low-to-mid price range, but rounded pricing remains competitive in high price points.
